# To-Do-App
The Flask To-Do List Web Application is a simple yet functional task management system built using Python (Flask) and MySQL. It allows users to create, view, update, complete, and delete tasks through a clean web interface. This project demonstrates the use of Flask for backend web development, CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
